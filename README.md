# orchestra-client

Control your Logitech Harmony Hubs from your browser! This is an HTML client for [orchestra-api](https://github.com/swissmanu/orchestra-api) based upon [React](https://github.com/facebook/react).

[orchestra](https://github.com/swissmanu/orchestra-client) combines the API and this client into a nice desktop application.
